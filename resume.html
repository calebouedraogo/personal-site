          <h3>Honeypot Project: Azure Sentinel Map with Live Cyber Attacks</h3>
          <p>The project demonstrated the global scale and distribution of cyber-attacks using Azure Sentinel and a purposely vulnerable VM, emphasizing the critical importance of network security and system hardening when deploying systems on the internet.</p>
          <p><ol>
            <li>Created an Azure account with an active subscription for the project.</li>
            <li>Deployed a Windows 10 Pro Virtual Machine (VM) and configured it to be highly visible on the internet, allowing all incoming traffic to ensure it is easily discoverable by potential attackers.</li>
            <li>Established a Log Analytics Workspace and configured Data Collection Rules to gather and monitor logs from the VM, successfully connecting the VM to the Log Analytics Workspace.</li>
            <li>Set up Azure Sentinel to visualize the collected data, configuring a Sentinel map with longitude and latitude data to display the geographic locations of cyber events.</li>
            <li>Accessed the VM via Remote Desktop and executed a custom PowerShell script to collect IP addresses from failed login attempts recorded in the VM's event viewer. These IP addresses were forwarded to a third-party API to determine their geolocation, and the resulting data was stored in a file on the VM. This log file was subsequently collected and ingested into the Log Analytics Workspace for visualization in Azure Sentinel.</li>
            <li>Within 30 minutes of the VM's creation, over 1,000 failed login attempts were recorded from around the globe, with attack origins including the United States, Russia, South Korea, Netherlands, Morocco, Brazil, and Turkey.</li>
            <p>This underscored the global reach and rapid onset of cyber-attacks, illustrating the necessity of robust network security measures and proactive monitoring using SIEM tools like Azure Sentinel or Splunk.</p>
            </ol>

          <h3>Active Directory Environment Project using VirtualBox</h3>
          <p><ol>
            <p>This project demonstrated the setup and management of an Active Directory environment in a virtualized setting, highlighting essential network engineering skills.</p>
            <li>Installed VirtualBox on a Mac machine for the project.</li>
            <li>Deployed and configured a Windows Server 2019 on VirtualBox to serve as a Domain Controller. The server was set up with two Network Interface Cards (NICs) - one for the internal network and another for internet access.</li>
            <li>Implemented Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on the server, creating a domain to establish a structured and secure network environment.</li>
            <li>Configured Remote Access Service (RAS) and Network Address Translation (NAT) on the server to enable client internet access through the server.</li>
            <li>Set up Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on the server to automate IP address assignment for clients on the network.</li>
            <li>Executed a custom PowerShell script to create 1000 user accounts on the server. Each account was assigned a username using the first letter of its userâ€™s first name followed by its last name, and a password.</li>
            <li>Installed and configured a Windows 10 Pro client on VirtualBox, joined to the domain, allowing all 1000 users to access the client using their credentials.</li>
            <p>This explained the practical application of network engineering principles in setting up and managing a comprehensive Active Directory environment within a virtualized infrastructure.</p>
              </ol>
